      <p class="section-gretting__text">I’m Jusung, a junior UX/UI Designer based in Seoul. With a background rooted in
        designing digital products for web/mobile applications, I have a particular interest in web development to
        create the actual product. I want to be a designer who is sensitive to technology and design trends, and who can
        accept anything whenever necessary.</p>
