        Hey there! I’m Jusung, a junior UX/UI Designer based in Seoul. I majored in Industrial Design at Konkuk University and mainly studied User eXperience Design.<br><br>
        I believe that good designers should be sensitive to design and technology trends, and have a flexible attitude to take what they need at any time. I am interested in design that can make business impact and improve development efficiency beyond simple and easy to use design.
